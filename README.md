## Project overview
Welcome to Interview Quest, a React-based game that simulates the challenging journey of a job interview process. Drawing inspiration from old-school turn-based RPGs and real-life job hunting experiences, this game takes you through three intense rounds: The Recruiter, The CTO, and the final showdown with the CEO. Your success in each round depends on your strategic use of engagement and charm. Best of luck!

## Technologies
- HTML-5
- CSS-3
- JavaScript
- React JS
- Vite
- Plesk

## Key Features 
1. Turn Based engagement: Navigate through the interview rounds using a turn-based system, where your decisions impact the outcome.
2. Progressively Challenging Levels: Encounter three levels of increasing difficulty—The Recruiter, The CTO, and the CEO—each presenting unique challenges and dynamics.
3. Charm Skills: Unlock and utilize various charm skills during the game, allowing you to influence the interviewer's interest positively. Strategically choose when to use these skills for maximum impact.
4. Interviewer Personalities: Each interviewer (Recruiter, CTO, CEO) has a distinct personality and preferred interview style.
5. Visual and Audio Effects: Enhance the gaming experience with graphics and sound effects that complement the mood of each interview round, making the game more immersive.
6. Just a bit of tounge and cheek: I don't beleive a recruiter would ever yawn, A CTO would scream FizzBuzz at you or CEO's ever stare deep into your soul.
